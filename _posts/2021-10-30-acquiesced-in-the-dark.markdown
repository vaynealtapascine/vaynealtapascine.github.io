<div id="poemPost unWrap">
<p>it dawned on me slowly–<br />
a realization ashen in crisp leaves<br />
the sound, sudden and swift,<br />
a roaring so tense yet alive<br />
i worry i've finally lost it:<br />
you will one day find your way too<br />
that this (whatever i promise this is)<br />
will be obsolesced by the world<br />
that we will be obscured<br />
the forest entrance buried<br />
the caverns made concrete<br />
the stone path turned powder.</p>
<p>we will fracture and the world i knew<br />
will be split: an<br />
uncharacteristic recollection<br />
of optimisms and followthroughs<br />
i never would have known without having loved you<br />
and the misanthropic flagellation<br />
so earnestly yours, who would have known it was<br />
really just me buried in your backyard?</p>
<p>and the crook of sunlight will remind me what it was like knowing<br />
what this safety was like, what this worry was like, what this<br />
insolent devastation was like, that i’d sooner forget<br />
“what was land even like?”<br />
before “what was even real before you?”</p>
<p>and i’d make the promise everyday as i always would have<br />
and i’d want to lie to myself and think i was good to you<br />
(even as you promised me i was)<br />
(to which, i’d be charitable when we were on the floor)<br />
(and, to that, i know you would have chastised me with a wry smile)<br />
and i’d close my eyes, to chisel this memory as an eternal moment<br />
between the what-could-have-beens and half-asleep-beside-you-in-beds<br />
and i’d summon all vanishings i’ve had<br />
just to keep this and you and grieve a little<br />
just a tiny bit<br />
less</p>
<p>but this is not a prayer.<br />
this is not rejection of our misalignment.<br />
we are made immortal, conceived and consoled at once,<br />
then diverging, six seconds off and trapped eternities apart.</p>
<p>the gods do not owe me.<br />
only you are owed eons by the loving i’ve left untouched.</p>
