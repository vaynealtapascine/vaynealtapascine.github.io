<div id="poemPost unWrap"><p>a million ink marks stain the letter i wrote to you<br />
like a word actually matters in the grand scheme of<br />
every fault</p>
<p>it matters to me that you receive the hundreds of<br />
receding stories left in the envelope that i<br />
wrote down and scrapped</p>
<p>the sun hurts my eyes, etching emblazoned symbols<br />
for the memories i never got to make but<br />
somehow they feel real enough to write the<br />
emotions to in a letter never to discuss</p>
<p>who's going to stop me, after all, when the sun drops,<br />
and the mailbox is off to bring<br />
a thousand fluttering butterflies onto a plane that spans<br />
the distance between the sky and the earth</p>
<p>will you even hear the words and<br />
voices and symbols i meant to write but never got to<br />
or will you just see ink stains written,</p>
<p>rewritten,<br />
rewritten,<br />
rewritten,<br />
rewritten,<br />
rewritten,</p>
<p>until i forgot what i meant?</p></div>
