<div id="poemPost unWrap"><p>do you see the wrinkles of your<br />
fingertip joints, the soft bundling of skin<br />
where i kiss them softly and you<br />
slip by my side?<br />
these hallways are scruffy and rubber shoes<br />
trace black skids, hidden there<br />
our fingers wrapped together<br />
between these grey slacks and your<br />
slip-stretched pencil skirt<br />
a closed clasping, curt and sincere hands<br />
writing drowsy in betweens where<br />
we were aloft, floating filled with just enough<br />
to be quiet,<br />
so slowly, gently crossing into each other's<br />
fragmenting homes,<br />
where rivers are still and oceans flow into<br />
the drought of scarring hearts<br />
and didn’t you know it, darling:<br />
we were awake only at the same time?</p>
<p>rarely have i brought worlds back to life,<br />
but for you, i make this bedroom whole:<br />
i tear open this world and become<br />
somewhere for you to cook dinner in,<br />
to sleep on the couch, to ask for coffee,<br />
and slowly, make opening my bedroom door<br />
your first thing tomorrow.</p>
<p>i am silly for believing. maybe.<br />
but these are good things.</p>
<p>who said we couldn’t make this<br />
every good thing we missed?</p></div>
