<div id="poemPost unWrap"><p>make a home in the crevice of my chest<br />
dig a grave under my heart<br />
pin your light into my lungs<br />
and crash your car into my ribs<br />
make it the graveyard of your hurt<br />
make me the burying itself<br />
the body and soil<br />
the graves and trees<br />
the wailing and eulogy<br />
make me the death itself</p></div>
