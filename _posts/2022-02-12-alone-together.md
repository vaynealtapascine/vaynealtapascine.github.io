<div id="poemPost unWrap"><p>barely heard in the dark,<br />
we are whispering so quietly about<br />
small fluttering lights far away.<br />
the night is longer<br />
than it used to be, i say,<br />
with the slightest hint of bravery<br />
but what do i know about courage?<br />
in here, i'm just a kid again,<br />
we're half our size,<br />
you're staring up into the sky,<br />
and nowhere else like here is there<br />
a soft deceit, a gentle reprieve<br />
from lightning from thunder, from<br />
roaring waves and scary monsters.<br />
the vastness of shared sleep<br />
tells me of only goodness.<br />
we are soothed by<br />
the emptiness of this place.<br />
this is alone. here<br />
we are together.</p></div>
