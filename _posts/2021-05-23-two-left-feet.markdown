<div id="poemPost unWrap"><p>can we try again?<br />
i have two left feet<br />
and the music is still playing.<br />
it's still three-four, one-two in the morning.<br />
my darling, i'm here still,<br />
our legs crossed over.<br />
we trip on each other and fall<br />
into fits of tired laughter.</p>
<p>can we try again?<br />
the ballroom is open.<br />
i want to waltz this time.<br />
it was beautiful to hold you so close<br />
but have it break from a misstep last time.<br />
there's a shunt in my veins<br />
and i leak apologies.<br />
i can't help my two left feet.<br />
please let me have this.</p>
<p>can we try again?<br />
the windows are cold<br />
and the floor is empty.<br />
the party is over but<br />
our song is still playing.<br />
you're so far, sitting by the empty table<br />
in that moonlit dress of yours.<br />
can you look my way just once<br />
just once again? yes, here,<br />
with my two left feet.<br />
and let me dance with you<br />
once more?</p></div>
