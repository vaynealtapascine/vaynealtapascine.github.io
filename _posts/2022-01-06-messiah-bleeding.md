<div id="poemPost unWrap"><p>my curled-up form<br />
resembles forest bugs.<br />
the body so carved, scars<br />
sit silhouetting even when<br />
the sky is clouded and the<br />
stars hardly shine<br />
and my bare chest and<br />
hollowed out face mar<br />
felicitations for daybreak<br />
people staring into my eye<br />
sockets, filling my nose<br />
with cocoons and caterpillars<br />
to make the sickening scent of<br />
morning ambrosia (“her <br />
favorite”, they call it)<br />
and i choke of blood, watching<br />
them cut apple slices from<br />
my excess, seething out as<br />
they cover my teeth in<br />
cotton candy and i sit polite<br />
about how you thrust incense<br />
into my ears and scarlet flowers<br />
bloom like that show you hate<br />
and lastly, they bend me over and<br />
fill my fuckhole with prayers,<br />
reciting exact commandments,<br />
impaling me on degenerate crosses<br />
(“a thief”, they call it), lavish<br />
and hanging next to other deities<br />
they don’t believe in, my insides<br />
whored out for the promised land<br />
where i wake up in the morning<br />
and know whose verses<br />
i need to recite for forgiveness.</p></div>
